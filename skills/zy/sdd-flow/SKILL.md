description: Drive a feature from idea to shipped using the full Spec-Driven Development pipeline — grill → prd → spec → TDD → review → doc maintenance — with an adversarial best-of-N auto-review-and-commit step on specs before the human gate, so specs are self-reviewed and landed before a human ever approves them. Use when the user wants to run the whole SDD flow end-to-end, says "take this idea and ship it" / "run the full flow" / "spec to ship", or wants the agent to review-and-commit specs on its own.

# SDD Flow

The end-to-end Spec-Driven Development pipeline. Each stage **delegates** to an existing skill — this skill owns only the hand-off, the best-of-N auto-review-and-commit on specs, and the human gates between stages. Do not restate the sub-skills' content here; invoke them.

Requires `/setup-skills` to have run in this repo (issue tracker, triage labels, domain docs). If `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` is missing, stop and run `/setup-skills` first.

```
idea → grill → prd → [Gate 0] → spec → [Gate A] → tdd(per spec) → review → summarize
                 ↑ redo              ↑ redo
```

**Invocation contract.** Every stage uses model-invoked skills, so this orchestrator chains the whole pipeline automatically: grilling = `/grilling` + `/domain-modeling`; then `/to-prd`, `/to-spec`, `/tdd`, `/codemap`. `/triage` and `/handoff` are user-invoked; this skill only reads triage's state or suggests the user run handoff, never invokes them.

## The best-of-N auto-review-and-commit step (used for specs)

`/to-spec` defaults to "draft, quiz the user, publish." This orchestrator wraps it with an adversarial review loop so a spec is self-vetted before a human ever sees it:

1. **Draft 2–3 candidates in parallel** — spawn that many `general-purpose` sub-agents in one message, each given the same brief (`/to-spec`'s template and quality bar, plus the project's `CONTEXT.md`, the approved PRD, and any ADRs in the touched area) but told to produce an _independent_ draft. Diversity is the point — don't let them converge. Do NOT publish yet.
2. **Judge** all candidates in a separate fresh-context sub-agent — never let a drafter grade its own work. Give the judge every candidate plus `/to-spec`'s **quality bar** (resolve the rules by skill name, not by restating them). It ranks them, picks the strongest, and returns a list of concrete defects in that winner, each tied to a checklist item.
3. **Refine** the winner to address every defect, then re-judge. Repeat until PASS, or until 3 rounds — at 3 rounds, stop and surface the remaining defects to the human rather than looping forever.
4. **Publish** the passing specs to the issue tracker in dependency order, each tagged `ready-for-agent`.

> For a trivial spec set you may drop to a single draft and skip straight to step 2's critique.

## Stages

### 1. Grill — `/grilling` + `/domain-modeling`

Run a `/grilling` session, using the `/domain-modeling` skill — interview the user one question at a time until the plan is fully resolved, sharpening terminology and updating `CONTEXT.md` and ADRs inline as you go. This is the model-invoked core of `/grill-with-docs` (which is just these two skills wrapped as a user-invoked entry point).

If the user arrives already-grilled (the conversation carries a resolved design), skip ahead to Stage 2. Don't skip otherwise — every later stage consumes this shared understanding.

### 2. PRD — `/to-prd`

Synthesize the PRD from the grilled context (no interview — `/to-prd` forbids it). `/to-prd` sketches test seams and confirms them with the user, then publishes the PRD to the issue tracker tagged `ready-for-agent`.

### Gate 0 — human reviews the PRD

Present the committed PRD. Ask exactly: **"PRD looks good → break into specs? Or redo the PRD?"**

- **Redo** → back to Stage 2, feeding the user's feedback into the next draft.
- **Approve** → Stage 3.

Do not start specs until the human approves.

### 3. Specs — `/to-spec` + best-of-N

Decompose the approved PRD into planning-complete specs (each one = one `/tdd` session). Run the best-of-N auto-review-and-commit step. Publish in dependency order so each spec can reference real identifiers in its `Blocked by` field.

### Gate A — human reviews the spec breakdown

Present the list (title, goal, parent, blocked-by, interface changes, behaviors to test). Ask: **"Specs look right → start building? Or redo the breakdown?"**

- **Redo** → back to Stage 3 with the user's feedback.
- **Approve** → Stage 4.

### 4. Build — `/tdd` per spec, in dependency order

For each approved spec whose blockers are done:

1. Pick the next unblocked spec (read the tracker's status/labels — set by `/triage` — if unclear).
2. Run `/tdd` — red-green-refactor, one vertical slice per tracer bullet. The spec already carries the interface and prioritized behaviors, so `/tdd` starts straight at red-green (no separate planning step).
3. Commit. Update the spec's status (`ready-for-human`, or closed per the tracker).
4. Next spec.

Continue until every approved spec is built.

### 5. Review — `/review` + fix

Run the two-axis SDD review (Standards + Spec) against the merge-base of the branch — the point just before Stage 4 started. Use `/review` if that skill is loaded; otherwise fall back to `/code-review`, or flag for manual review if neither is available. Fix every hard finding, then re-run until clean or the only remaining findings are explicit judgement calls the human accepts.

### 6. Summarize & maintain docs

Before declaring done:

- [ ] Sweep `CONTEXT.md` for terms introduced during the build; add any still missing.
- [ ] Offer ADRs for any hard-to-reverse, surprising, real-trade-off decisions made along the way (the `/grill-with-docs` bar — sparingly).
- [ ] If code terrain shifted materially, run `/codemap` **drift-check** against the relevant `docs/codemap/` map — if it reports drift, update the affected map (skip if `/codemap` isn't loaded).
- [ ] Write a one-paragraph summary of what shipped, with pointers to the PRD / specs / PR — not a re-narration.
- [ ] If work continues in another session, suggest the user run `/handoff`.

## When NOT to use this skill

- One-off fix or trivial change → just `/tdd` or `/diagnosing-bugs` directly.
- You already have a PRD → start at Stage 3 (specs).
- You already have specs → start at Stage 4 (build).
- The repo hasn't run `/setup-skills` → run that first.
